# Zentangles Generator

This code creates a zentangles generator in p5.js.


## Generating Grid Images

I am using low resolution grayscale images to determine which shapes are rendered in the grid. The images are created using several different methods. First, I did a search for free cross stitch patterns, and then adapted the ones that I thought would be best suited to my use case. I stuck to fairly simple designs, such as flowers and animals. Second, I uploaded some of my landscape images 


While it would be possible to expand beyond 4 colors, for simplicity sake that is all I am using.
